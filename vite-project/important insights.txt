.files & there responsibilities:
    App.jsx             --->    What data exist
    components(Card.jsx)---> how it looks
.because of props--> reuse the component  by same component,
                                             Different Data,
                                             Zero duplication
    <Card name="A" description="Developer" />
    <Card name="B" description="Designer" />
    <Card name="C" description="Tester" />-->jsx code 

.One-Way Data Flow:
    Parent --> Child -->can read only props
    (App)  --> (Card)    

.Card() is called by React,in rendering phase when App() returns jsx containing Card().
.props is an javaScript object,created by React which contains attributes,
   and further passed to component.  
.Changing details affect the UI,bcoz,when React re-runs the app,passes new props to card 
   and re-build virtualDOM,compares vth previous one and update new one.
.browser DOM actually changes ,when compare new Virtual DOM vth old one,
  only apply neccessary changes to real DOM.

Total Work Flow:
 Browser loads index.html
      ↓
ReactDOM finds #root div
      ↓
React calls App()
      ↓
App returns JSX
       ↓
React sees <Card />
       ↓
React calls Card(props)
      ↓
DOM is created

 Role of React:
 1.call component function
 2.Convert JSX to real HTML
 3.Update the DOM when data changes

Q & A
1.If App.jsx re-runs but Card.jsx code
  does NOT change, why does Card still re-render?
a. Because Card is a child of App, when App re-renders, 
React re-invokes Card’s function to compute the UI again, which causes Card to re-render even if its code hasn’t changed.
